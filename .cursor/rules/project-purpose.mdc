# Project Purpose: Código Obsidiana

The **Código Obsidiana** project is the personal website and professional portfolio of Ariel Itzli Molina Sánchez, a seasoned frontend developer with over 8 years of experience. The site aims to:

- **Showcase Expertise**: Highlight Ariel's proficiency in React, UI architecture, and 3D learning experiences.
- **Demonstrate Projects**: Present a curated selection of projects across fintech, user management, and banking industries in Mexico.
- **Share Knowledge**: Provide technical articles and tutorials to educate and engage the developer community.
- **Reflect Personal Brand**: Embody the 'Código Obsidiana' identity, merging technical excellence with cultural inspiration.

The website is built using modern technologies, including Astro for static site generation, Tailwind CSS for styling, and integrates React components where interactivity is required.
