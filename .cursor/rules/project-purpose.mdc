## project-purpose

This project is the source code for **“Código Obsidiana”** — a bilingual personal website built with Astro, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI.

Its purpose is to serve as both:
- A technical blog where Ariel Molina shares in-depth frontend content, tutorials, and project insights (with focus on React, 3D, education, architecture, tooling).
- A lightweight but elegant personal portfolio under the `/about` route.

The homepage prioritizes content creation and community growth. Posts are central to the experience and link naturally to open-source tools, experiments, and long-term side projects.

The site is fully multilingual (English & Spanish), SEO-optimized, and structured to scale with future initiatives like newsletters and Discord.
