# Project Branding and Content Guidelines

1. **Brand Identity**: Ensure all content aligns with the 'CÃ³digo Obsidiana' brand, reflecting themes of elegance, technical depth, personal authorship, and cultural inspiration through obsidian symbolism.

2. **Visual Language**: Use a dark, minimal, and editorial aesthetic. Base backgrounds are `#0f1923` and `#2c3844`. Action elements use cool blues (`#4CA5FF`, `#5FBCFF`), and the signature accent is obsidian-orange (`#FF8357`). All colors should be defined in `oklch()` for visual consistency.

3. **Typography**:
   - Headlines: `Playfair Display` - serif, elegant, high contrast.
   - Body: `Inter` - clean, technical, modern sans-serif.

4. **Content Structure**: Organize markdown content in `src/content/`, categorizing by type (e.g., `blog/`, `projects/`, `about/`) and language (`en/`, `es/`).

5. **Frontmatter**: Include consistent metadata (`title`, `description`, `lang`, `tags`, etc.) and apply localization context where applicable.

6. **Markdown Styling**: Use consistent heading levels, spacing, and semantic elements. Favor clarity and typographic rhythm over excessive styling.

7. **Media Assets**: Store images and videos in `public/assets/`, using compressed formats and descriptive names. Include localized variants if needed.

8. **Localization**: All content should support both English and Spanish. Follow the folder convention (`src/content/en/`, `src/content/es/`) and ensure each post has metadata and visible language switch options.

9. **SEO Optimization**: Prioritize meaningful, human-readable slugs, proper `<meta>` descriptions per locale, and keywords related to frontend development and personal branding.

10. **Accessibility**: Use semantic HTML, descriptive `alt` text for images, and maintain legibility across light/dark themes.
