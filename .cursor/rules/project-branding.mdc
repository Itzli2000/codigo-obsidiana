# Project Branding and Content Guidelines

1. **Brand Identity**: Ensure all content aligns with the 'CÃ³digo Obsidiana' brand, reflecting themes of elegance, technical proficiency, and cultural inspiration.

2. **Content Structure**: Organize markdown content in `src/content/`, categorizing by type (e.g., `blog/`, `projects/`, `about/`).

3. **Frontmatter**: Include relevant frontmatter in markdown files (e.g., `title`, `date`, `description`, `tags`) for consistent metadata.

4. **Markdown Styling**: Use consistent markdown syntax for headings, lists, code blocks, and other elements to maintain readability.

5. **Media Assets**: Reference media assets (images, videos) stored in `public/assets/`, ensuring they are optimized for web performance.

6. **Localization**: If supporting multiple languages, structure content directories accordingly (e.g., `en/`, `es/`) and implement localization logic.

7. **SEO Optimization**: Incorporate SEO best practices in content, including meaningful titles, descriptions, and keyword usage.

8. **Content Updates**: Regularly review and update content to keep information current and relevant.

9. **Linking**: Use relative links for internal navigation and ensure all links are functional and up-to-date.

10. **Accessibility**: Ensure all content is accessible, using appropriate alt text for images and semantic HTML structures.
